 This project is a quick POC put together to interact with VRising server - including extracting a player map.

# Compiling
This requires proxy dll's to compile. Unfortunately, it uses a custom branch of Il2CppAssemblyUnhollower that includes .net support. Maybe this will get merged back eventually. It also includes some other minor bug fixes.
